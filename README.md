- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucioawa
- 👀 I’m interested in tattoos, architectural design, painting, art history, economics, linguistics, psychology, data science, and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently transitioning from an architectural designer into a technical designer role, while at the same time trying to have a tattoo-artist career (2 years experience lol)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects like: tattoos, music, motion graphics, data visualization.
- 📫 Reach me at: lucioawa@gmail.com or at my insta: @belzabiel 
- 😄 Pronouns: I believe we all carry many identities, but at the core, I choose to identify as a spirit who is blessed to experience life with all the people, the food, the animals.. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also want to have a band like Black Sabbath, Tool, or Korn; I play guitar and sing in English/Spanish, so hit me up let's make a band over zoom or whatever.
